# AiCode - CLI Coding Assistant

## Overview
AiCode is a resource-efficient CLI coding assistant optimized for small local models. It provides an interactive shell with full tool execution capabilities, model switching, and image analysis.

## Core Features

### ü§ñ Model Management
- Support for multiple local model endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI-compatible)
- Easy model switching during runtime
- Connection testing and status monitoring
- Optimized prompts for small models with limited context

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Execution System
- File operations (read, write, create, delete, list directories)
- Terminal command execution with safety checks
- Code analysis and syntax error detection
- Basic code formatting capabilities
- Safe mode with user confirmation for dangerous operations

### üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis
- Visual debugging and understanding capabilities
- Image optimization for small models
- Basic visual analysis (colors, dimensions, complexity)
- Image comparison functionality
- Text region detection (basic implementation)

### üí¨ Interactive Shell
- Rich CLI interface with syntax highlighting
- Command completion and history
- Context management and conversation tracking
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- Multiple prompt optimization strategies

## Configuration

### Model Endpoints
- **Default**: `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`
- **Ollama**: `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`
- **LM Studio**: `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`
- **Custom**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

### Settings
- **Max Tokens**: 2048 (optimized for small models)
- **Temperature**: 0.7
- **Context Length**: 4096 tokens
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Safe Mode**: Enabled by default

## Tool Categories

### File Operations
- `read_file(path)` - Read file content with syntax highlighting
- `write_file(path, content)` - Write content to file
- `list_directory(path)` - List directory contents
- `create_directory(path)` - Create directories
- `delete_file(path)` - Delete files (with confirmation)
- `file_exists(path)` - Check file existence

### Terminal Operations
- `execute_command(command)` - Run shell commands safely
- `get_working_directory()` - Get current directory
- `change_directory(path)` - Change working directory

### Code Analysis
- `analyze_code(code, language)` - Analyze code structure and metrics
- `find_syntax_errors(code, language)` - Detect syntax errors
- `format_code(code, language)` - Basic code formatting

## Command Reference

### Shell Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/models` - List configured models with status
- `/switch <model>` - Switch to different model
- `/tools` - Show available tools
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/history` - Show recent conversation
- `/context` - Show current context
- `/image <path>` - Analyze image file
- `/debug` - Enter debug mode
- `/analyze <file>` - Analyze code file
- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit AiCode

### Usage Patterns
- **Natural conversation**: Ask coding questions directly
- **Explicit tool calls**: Use `TOOL: tool_name(param="value")` syntax
- **File analysis**: `/analyze filename.py`
- **Image debugging**: `/image screenshot.png`
- **Model switching**: `/switch ollama`

## Optimization for Small Models

### Prompt Engineering
- Compressed context management
- Specialized system prompts for different tasks
- Context truncation to fit token limits
- Efficient message formatting

### Performance Features
- Image size optimization for vision models
- Code analysis without external dependencies
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast response processing

## Safety Features

### Safe Mode
- Confirmation prompts for dangerous operations
- File path validation
- Command filtering for destructive operations
- User consent for system-level changes

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure recovery
- Detailed error messages
- Connection retry logic
- Input validation

## Context Management

### Conversation History
- Stores recent user-assistant exchanges
- Automatic context compression
- Relevant context injection
- Session persistence

### File Context
- Code file analysis results
- Image analysis metadata
- Tool execution outcomes
- Working directory tracking

## Supported Languages

### Primary Support
- Python (full AST analysis)
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- JSON/YAML

### Basic Support
- Shell scripts
- Configuration files
- Text files
- Log files

## Integration Points

### Local Model Servers
- **Ollama**: Direct API integration
- **LM Studio**: OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Custom servers**: Any OpenAI-format API

### Development Workflow
- Code analysis and review
- Error debugging and fixing
- File management and organization
- Terminal command execution

## Best Practices

### For Small Models
- Keep prompts concise and focused
- Use specific, targeted questions
- Leverage tool execution for complex tasks
- Break down large problems into smaller steps

### For Safety
- Always enable safe mode in production
- Review file operations before execution
- Use relative paths when possible
- Backup important files before modifications

### For Efficiency
- Switch models based on task complexity
- Use image analysis for visual debugging
- Leverage conversation history for context
- Use specific commands for common tasks

## Error Recovery

### Common Issues
- Model connection failures
- File permission errors
- Syntax errors in code
- Tool execution timeouts

### Recovery Strategies
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to basic functionality
- User notification and guidance
- Graceful degradation
